###Learning what cloud vendors besides AWS provide for DevOps

Microsoft AZURE, GCP (Google Cloud Platform), ...

according to Baker-Miller on Reddit..."GCP is built for developers. Azure is built for sysadmins. AWS is built for infra systems engineers."


"AWS was certainly first, has the most services and biggest user base/revenue. When they say it isn't expanding, is that in pure customers or straight revenue since those are a better indicator due to a larger base.

You can't go wrong with AWS, but the GCP, Azure and others will still get new customers and will grow. A quick Google shows 50% workloads moved to the cloud. Plenty of business left for everyone.

Someone is always going to be first and there will always be competition but at this point I can't see the positions changing any time soon."- Classicrock40
